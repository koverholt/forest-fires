## Data Structure

The data used for this project is all publicly available. At this point, I am using three subgroups of data: 

1.) [Fire detection data](http://firemapper.sc.egov.usda.gov/gisdata.php)
2.) [State, County, Region, and Urban Area shapfiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html)
3.) [Fire perimeter Boundaries](http://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/outgoing/GeoMAC/historic_fire_data/)

All of the zipped files that I have downloaded to use (namely 2013, 2014) are in the zipped_files folder
in this data subdirectory. Data from (1) above are in the /data/deteced_fires subdirectory, and data from (2) above are located in the data/boundary_files subdirectory.
